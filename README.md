# Retrodup

An intergated retroduplication caller based on 1) exon-exon junction and 2) discordant reads
Please refer to /*Landscape and Variation of Novel Retroduplications in 26 Human Populations*/. 


1. Create junction libraries
2. Extract unmapped reads and re-map to junctions
3. Call retroduplications from exon-exon junction
4. Cluster the discordant reads to discover insertion sites
